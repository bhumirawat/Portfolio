          Hi, I'm Bhumika Rawat, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong 
          foundation in the MERN stack and C++ for Data Structures & Algorithms. 
          I recently completed my B.Tech in Information Technology (2025) from AKTU, 
          and I'm eager to begin my journey in a dynamic, innovation-driven environment.<br/><br/>

          I love crafting user-centric web applications that are both visually 
          engaging and technically robust. My passion lies in turning ideas into 
          functional, impactful digital experiences â€” blending clean design, 
          optimized code, and seamless interactivity. I approach every challenge 
          with curiosity, creativity, and a problem-solving mindset, continuously 
          learning and adapting to new technologies.<br/><br/>

          My goal is to join an innovative tech company where I can contribute to
          meaningful projects, collaborate with talented teams, and grow into a 
          well-rounded full stack engineer. You can explore my work and projects on&nbsp;
